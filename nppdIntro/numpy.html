          <h2>Use NumPy to create arrays and special arrays</h2>
          <p>
            As what we can see in the image below, two ways to create arrays is
            presented. On the left of the image, the function np.array() is
            called and the input is a list which stored number 1 and 2. By the
            line that data = np.array([1,2]), an array contains number 1 and 2
            is created and is stored in the variable data.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some special case, we don't know about the specific values that
            should be stored in the array, but we know how many values there are
            to store. In this case we need to create an array with given length.
            Then, the right function is our choice. By given a nnumber as input
            to np.ones() it would return an array with the given number as
            length and all the values inside would be number 1.

          <h2>How can we refer to the data store in array?</h2>
          <p>
            The graph below address the concept that each element in array has a
            corresponding index, which allow as to access the data stored in
            array through the efficient. From the left-most graph, we can see
            that the index of the first number is zero, and index will increase
            1 for each element after. Thus, with data[0] we can get the first
            element, and data[1] for the seconde.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the situation we want to access more than one data
            continuously,we will use data[0:2] and data[1:], which corresponding
            to get all the elmement with index large or equal to 0 and smaller
            than 2, get all the data with index larger than 1, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, in some special cases, we want to access data in reverse
            order. In contrast to the normal order, in reverser order, the last
            element stored is idnexed as -1 and will decrease 1 for each element
            before. Thus, to get the last 2 element we can use data[-2:] -- get
            all the data with index larger or equal to -2, which is index -2 and
            index -1.

          <h2>Add, substract, multiply, and divide of arrays</h2>
          <p>
            The below pitcure shows the basic operation we can apply to arrays
            with same length. For the add, subtract, multiply and divide between
            two arrays. The result would just be the array that stored the sum,
            difference, product, or quotient of the two element from two arrays
            at corresponding index.
