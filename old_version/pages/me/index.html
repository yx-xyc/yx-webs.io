      <h2>Image Concept</h2>
      <p>
        Asa people with severe acrophobia, I would never ever climb up to the
        top to take selfie, cause I would cry rather smile in that situation. So
        I create this image that I am on a skyscraper do a selfie with both sun
        and moon in the background, which is a rare astronomical phomenomenon.
