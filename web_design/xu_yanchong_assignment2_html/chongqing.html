        <h3>Spicy Food</h3>
        <p>
          After the lesson in Chengdu, in Chongqing resturant, we told waitress
          that we are not native people, and that's why our dish is not covered
          completely by hot pepper. With moderate spicy taste, , we enjoy
          Chongqing food much more than Sichuan food. In fact, Chonqing food
          supposed to be much spicy than Sichuan food for that they would prefer
          use hot pepper directly instead of hot oil which is prefered by
          Sichuan people.

        <h3>Building</h3>
        <p>
          The building and landform of Chonqing can be described as unique. As a
          city scatters in a moutain, it is a usual scenario that walking down a
          stree and encounter a cliff. To accomodate this special landform, the
          building in Chonqing is also a unique sight. For the left graph, you
          can see a bridge shuttle among skysscrapers for transportation. For
          the right graph, it's four huge building built on at the confluence of
          the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers in the Peninsula of Yuzhong District in
          Chongqing.
