          <h2>What does numpy do here?</h2>
          <p>
            In this case, numpy is used to calculate a system of equation of
            equations, which is consist of -x +2y -z = 9, 3x-7y-2z-20,
            2x+2y+z=1. Some knowledge of linear algebra is applied in this case,
            so that this system of equations could be solved by simply multiply
            two matrix.

          <h2>What are the functions applied in this case?</h2>
          <p>
            The first function applied here is np.matrix(). By giving arrays to
            this function it would used matrix to store these data. Then, the
            second function applied here is np.matrix().I which is convert the
            matrix created to the inverse so that the result of the
            multiplication is the solution to this system of equations.
