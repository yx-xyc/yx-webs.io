          <h2>What is numpy and pandas?</h2>
          <p>
            Entering the era of digitalization, the amount of data is increasing
            in exponential speed â€” your browser history, your favorite song
            list, lecture recordings, study materials. All these information is
            created and stored by digitalization, making the availability of
            data become unprecedentedly high. To better process and dig into all
            the data created, Numpy and Pandas, as two extremely convenient
            python package, is introduced.

          <h2>When to use numpy?</h2>
          <p>
            As the name numpy, combination of number and python, indicated,
            numpy frequently used to handle all the numeric values and
            arithmetic process. By providing two typical types of data
            structure, array and matrix, both unidimensional and
            multidimensional datasets can be processed. Moreover, by
            subscripting and slicing a array, the data stored in the array can
            be easily accessed and, by encapsulated function of numpy, all the
            complex process, such as transpose, matrix multiplication, sort can
            all be easily done by only one line of code, increasing the
            efficiency of data processing unprecedentedly. All these scenario
            mentioned above are when numpy is needed.

          <h2>When to use pandas?</h2>
          <p>
            As a package that is based on numpy and designed to supplement the
            shortage of numpy, pandas pay attentions to presenting the content
            of data, especially on the data accessibility. Based on the numpy
            array, pandas designed the data structure Series, which could be
            seen as a combination of a list and dictionary. Beside slicing and
            subscripting, the data stored could also be accessed through the
            form of key-value pair: by given the key, the value can be accessed,
            vise versa. Based on Series, the most featured data structure in
            pandas, DataFrame is created. A DataFrame could be seen as a
            combination of multiple Series that forms a table: each Series is a
            column in the table. With this data structure, you can easily find a
            specific cell in a datasets that is consist of thousands of rows and
            columns, contributing to increase the data accessibility.
